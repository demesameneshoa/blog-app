## 📖 Blog_App <a name="about-project"></a>

The Blog app is a classic example of a blog website designed by ruby on rails with a database by PostgreSQL. I have created a fully functional website that will show the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts.

## 🛠 Tech-stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

The Blog_App code decoding project utilizes the Ruby on Rails programming language, celebrated for its graceful syntax and adaptability. The choice of RoR as the foundation for this endeavor stems from its user-friendly nature and robust string manipulation capabilities.


## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

The construction of this project relies on Ruby on Rails, an open-source and dynamic programming language recognized for its simplicity and efficiency. The attractiveness of Ruby stems from its refined syntax and robust features, making it a favored option among developers.
